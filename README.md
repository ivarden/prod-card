## This is the test project for the job interview.

### Step 1
Create markup and styles for a “product card” that shows a product image, title, price, and rating. You can choose products you want to display and their details. The products could be clothes, sporting items, or even books 😊
When hovering over the card the image should fade out and show an “Add to Cart” button.
During our tech interview, we will add a small level of interaction to the card using JavaScript. Feel free to use jQuery, React, Vue.js, or any other libraries you like (or vanilla JS).
